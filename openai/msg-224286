The scope of a data scientist involves the following:

1. Data analysis and modeling: Data scientists use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze large datasets and extract valuable insights. They develop models to identify patterns, trends, and make predictions.

2. Machine learning: Data scientists use machine learning algorithms to create models that can learn from data, improve over time, and make accurate predictions or classifications.

3. Statistical analysis: Data scientists apply statistical methods and techniques to interpret data, validate models, and make data-driven decisions.

4. Data visualization: Data scientists use tools and techniques to represent data visually, making it easier for others to understand and interpret complex datasets.

5. Data cleaning and preprocessing: Data scientists cleanse and preprocess raw data to remove inconsistencies, errors, and ensure data quality before analysis.

6. Big data processing: Data scientists work with big data technologies and frameworks to handle and process large volumes of data efficiently.

The scope of a web developer involves the following:

1. Web application development: Web developers create websites and web applications using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They design the layout, implement functionality, and ensure user-friendly interfaces.

2. Front-end development: Web developers focus on building the user interface and experience for web applications. They work with
