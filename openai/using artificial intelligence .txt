4. Macroeconomic Imbalances: Imbalances like high inflation, excessive household or corporate debt, overvalued assets, or unsustainable levels of consumption and investment can eventually lead to a recession.

5. External Shocks: External events such as natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks, or public health crises (like the COVID-19 pandemic) can disrupt economic activities and trigger recessions.
